# Software Installation Guide

We need three software components: **git**, **R** and **Python 3**. The Python component also require two add-ons: **Jupyter Notebook** and **NLTK**. 


## Troubleshooting
If you run into problems, please:
- Email the instructors. Note your OS (Windows? Mac?) and give us a description of how and where you are stuck. Screenshots work wonders. 
- On the workshop day, arrive early at 8:30am. The instructors will be ready to get hands-on with your laptop.

## Python 3

There are a LOT of Python distributions and therefore many ways and flavors of Python installation. Two recommended options:

- If you are completely new to Python, you should install Anaconda Python. It includes all three components. ([OPTION 1](#option-1-install-everything-through-anaconda)) 
- If you already have a working copy of Python 3 on your machine, you can install Jupyter Notebook and NLTK separately. ([OPTION 2](#option-2-already-have-python-add-on-components-separately)) 

###  OPTION 1: Install everything through Anaconda (5.3.1 version)

There are many flavors of Python, but we recommend Anaconda's distribution. Anaconda has the advantage of already including popular scientific libraries such as NLTK. It also includes the Jupyter Notebook interface. (The downside is that it also installs lots of things you might never need.)

#### Install
- Go to Anaconda Python's download page: [http://www.anaconda.com/download/](http://www.anaconda.com/download/)

- Make sure you download and install the **Python 3.7 version**. Important!
- 64-bit vs. 32-bit: if your system can handle it (most modern systems can), we recommend 64-bit, which is Anaconda's default choice also. 
- Double-click the downloaded setup file to start the installation process. Details:
   - Ignore the question about installing Visual Studio Code. We don't need it. 
   - A "Get the cheat sheet" dialog box will pop up asking for your email. You can ignore it. 
   - The setup file is 600MB; You will need 3GB of space on your hard drive.
   - Ignore messages about signing up for Anaconda Cloud.
   - The default settings and options should work fine for most of you.   

#### Verify Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks
Depending on your system, Anaconda may take a while to install. Once it finishes, check your installation: 

- Find Anaconda Navigator in your start menu (or Applications folder on Mac), launch it
- Launch Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter opens up as a tab in your browser (Safari, Chrome, FireFox, etc.). You should be able to see your personal folders such as `Desktop` and `Documents`. 

### OPTION 2: Already have Python, add on components separately
<img src='img/python_jupyter_nltk.w200.png' align=right>

If you already have a working copy of Python 3 on your machine (perhaps you installed [python.org](https://www.python.org/) version of Python at some point), then you have a choice:

1. Keep your existing Python copy, and install the Anaconda version separately. Both copies of Python will work independently. To go with this option, follow the [Anaconda installation instructions above](#option-1-install-everything-through-anaconda). 

1. Add NLTK and Jupyter Notebook to your existing Python 3. This is a sensible thing to do! Follow instructions below. 

#### Install
- Open up a console. For Windows users, it's `cmd` (you might need to choose "Run as administrator" option); for Mac users, it's `Terminal`. ([Screenshot](img/cmd-pip3.png))
- First, make sure your `pip3` is accessible: `where pip3` (Windows), `which pip3` (Mac). It should show pip's installation path.
- If that worked, you can go ahead and install:
	- Install NLTK: `pip3 install nltk`
	- Install Jupyter Notebook: `pip3 install jupyter`
- If `where pip3` fails, then `pip3` is not in your system's path. Try and see if you can find it in places like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Python36-32\Scripts`, `C:\Users\naraehan\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts`. Once you have successfully located `pip3`, you will have to execute each installation command by fully specifying its path, e.g.,:
	```
	C:\Users\naraehan\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts\pip3 install nltk
	```


#### Verify
Let's check if your installation was successful. 

- Open up a console and type in `jupyter notebook`, followed by ENTER
- Jupyter opens up as a tab in your browser (Safari, Chrome, FireFox, etc.). You should be able to see your personal folders such as `Desktop` and `Documents`. 
- On the right-hand side, click on "New", choose "Python 3".
- Another tab opens up. In the box, type in this line:
	```python
	import nltk
	```
- Then hit the play â–¶ button on top. 
- If there is no error, your installation was successful. You can now close the browser window -- no saving necessary. 

## R and R Studio
There are two options for installing R and RStudio. <img src='img/r-logo.png' align=right>

1. If you plan to install Python 3 with Anaconda, you can simply Install R and RStudio using Anaconda Navigator **(Choose Option 1)**. <img src='img/rstudio-logo-flat.png' align=right>

2. However, if you don't plan to install Anaconda, it's quite simple to install R and RStudio  **(Choose Option 2)**. 



### OPTION 1: Install RStudio as a part of Anaconda
Anaconda doesn't install RStudio by default, so you need to install it. Luckily, it's quite simple. 

- In the Anaconda Navigator window, click Install RStudio (1.1.456 version)
- It will take some time to install, there's a progress bar in the lower right corner to show it's working
- You may also be asked to update Anaconda Navigator; it's okay to install and relaunch
- Lauch RStudio and desktop app will open

### OPTION 2: Install R and RStudio 
R and RStudio are downloaded and installed separately. 

1. Download R from [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
	- Select the appropriate version of R for your machine, which takes you to another page
	- **Mac Users:** 
		- Under the heading *Latest Release* download **R-3.5.1.pkg** and run the installer
		-  It is also a good idea to download and install XQuartz ([https://www.xquartz.org/](https://www.xquartz.org/))
	- **Windows Users:** 
		- Under the heading *Subdirectories* select **base**
		- Then, select **Download R 3.5.1 for Windows** and run the installer
1. Download [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com) from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
	- Select the *free* download and choose the appropriate installer for your machine
	- Run the installers 
	- **Mac Users** simply drag the RStudio.app file into your Applications folder
