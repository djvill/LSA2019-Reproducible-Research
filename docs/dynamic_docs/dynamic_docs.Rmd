# Dynamic documents

- To my knoweledge term coined by Yihui Xie for the R package `knitr` based on earlier versions of `Sweave`
- `knitr`allows us to create documents in various formats (e.g., LateX, Markdown) with various outputs (HTML slides, `Shiny` apps, PDF documents), all of which combines Markup and executable code.
