# Dynamic documents

- To my knoweledge term coined by Yihui Xie for the R package `knitr` based on earlier versions of `Sweave`
- `knitr`allows us to create documents in various formats (e.g., LateX, Markdown) with various outputs (HTML slides, `Shiny` apps, PDF documents), all of which combines Markup and executable code.
- In the breakout section, we'll primarily work with **RMarkdown**, an *R-flavor* of traditional Markdown.
  - I will show one example of `knitr` with LaTeX

# Benefits & drawbacks of RMarkdown


.pull-left[
- It's simple. 
- It's portable

.pull-right[
- Few native formatting options
  - e.g., interlinear glossed examples not straightforward

# Breaking down the components of a dynamic document with RMarkdown

Dynamic documents are composed of: 

1. YAML header: Contains metadata for the document
2. R code chunks
3. Text

Let's break down the YAML header and R code chunks...

---

# YAML header
The YAML header contains... 
  1. **metadata**
    - author
    - title 
    - date
  1. **output formats**
    - HTML
    - Markdown
    - PDF
    - Word
    
Here's a basic example...

```yaml
---
title: "A basic example"
author: "Bradley McDonnell"
date: "12/29/2018"
output: html_document
---
```

---

# YAML header

The YAML header can be quite complicated.
- The `output` can contain a number of options (which is quite helpful!).

# Code chunks

- Code chunks are where we place the R code that we want to execute.


````markdown
The plot below shows a slight increase in intensity in the final syllable of the word. 

`r ''````{r boxplot, echo=TRUE, eval=require('tidyverse'), comment="#", message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

# Loading the dataframe
pse_stress <- read_tsv("data/pse-stress-simplified.csv") %>% 
                          mutate(Word = fct_recode(Word),
                                Position = fct_recode(Position),
                                Vowel = fct_recode(Vowel),
