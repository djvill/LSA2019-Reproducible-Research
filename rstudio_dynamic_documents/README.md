# RStudio & Dynamic documents with R Markdown

## Connecting Rstudio and GitHub
We will follow instructions from the book [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR
](http://happygitwithr.com/). We'll specifically look at sections [12.3.1](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#option-1-set-up-from-rstudio), [12.4.1](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#option-1-set-up-from-rstudio), [12.5.3](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#on-github). If we run into issues with your computer, we can look in these sections for answers.


### In RStudio
- Step 1: In RStudio, Go to *Tools > Global Options…> Git/SVN*
- Step 2: Click *Enable version control interface for RStudio projects*
- Step 3: Under `SSH RSA Key`, click *Create RSA Key...* <br/> (It will ask you for a passphrase, but let's skip that for the time being.)
- Step 4: Once the key is created click *View public key*
- Step 5: Copy the key.

### In GitHub

- Click on profile pic and go to Settings
- then SSH and GPG keys. 
- Click “New SSH key”. 
- Paste your public key in the “Key” box. 
- Give it an informative title, presumably related to the comment you used above, during key creation. For example, you might use 2018-mbp to record the year and computer. 
- Click “Add SSH key”.
